                My name is Allegra Iacovino and I am an AFAA/NASM certified Group Fitness Instructor and Spin Instructor.  I have been very active my entire  life,  while being a competitive swimmer since the age of seven years old. Around the time I was in High School I realized that I could advance my swimming achievements by training harder in and outside the pool. So I began going to fitness classes and learning how to strength train. I continued my swim career through college for Roger Williams University where I was on the varsity team and captain my senior year. I put in the hard work for so many years and I knew I wanted to grow this passion of mine into a dream of becoming a fitness instructor, where I could help and inspire others to put in the hard work and achieve their goals. 
                <br>
                <br>
                In 2020 I received my Group Fitness Instructor certification through AFAA/NASM. Since then I have taught a variety of classes such as; HIIT, Strength, Spin, Boxing, and even some Yoga. I am learning everyday through studying and hands on experience how to instruct and help myself and others in the gym. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Not only have I found a reward in fitness physically, I have also found an immense benefit mentally. My goal is  to have others share the same experience and excel physically and mentally. I want to ditch the stigma of going to the gym for appearance only and make it about going to the gym to better yourself all around, exercising for mind, body and soul! To  enable and instill   confidence and ultimately living the best version of oneself. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I love what I do and I am so excited to be sharing my passion with all of you! I believe that you are amazing and can do anything you put your heart into.
                <br>

                Thank you for taking the time to check me out and follow my journey. I love every single one of you
