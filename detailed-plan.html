                    <p id = "about-program">This program is perfect for someone who wants to follow more of a structured gym schedule but does not exactly know where to start!  Each workout contains 4-6 strength exercises with added cardio at the end. Each week of the six weeks stays the same so you can find that consistency in the gym. The idea is to progressive overload, which means as the weeks are going by you are going heavier in weight and dropping down the reps. This will challenge your body and create the strongest, most confident version of yourself! </p>
